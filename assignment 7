1. Applications for different types of RNNs:
   - Sequence-to-sequence RNN: Language translation, chatbots, speech recognition, text summarization, image captioning.
   - Sequence-to-vector RNN: Sentiment analysis, document classification, video classification, text generation.
   - Vector-to-sequence RNN: Image captioning, text-to-speech synthesis, music generation.

2. The inputs of an RNN layer should have three dimensions: (batch_size, time_steps, input_features). Each dimension represents:
   - batch_size: The number of sequences or samples processed in parallel during training.
   - time_steps: The number of time steps in the sequence, indicating the length of input sequences.
   - input_features: The number of features or dimensions in each time step of the input sequence.

   The outputs of an RNN layer also have three dimensions: (batch_size, time_steps, output_features). The output_features dimension represents the number of features in the output sequence of each time step.

3. In a deep sequence-to-sequence RNN, the RNN layers that should have `return_sequences=True` are the ones that connect to subsequent RNN layers. By setting `return_sequences=True`, these layers will output a sequence for each time step instead of a single output. The final RNN layer should typically have `return_sequences=False` to produce a single output.

   In a sequence-to-vector RNN, only the last RNN layer needs to have `return_sequences=False` to produce a single output representing the entire sequence.

4. For forecasting the next seven days based on a daily univariate time series, you can use a stacked LSTM model. The LSTM model can take a fixed window of past observations as input and predict the future sequence. You can stack multiple LSTM layers to capture more complex temporal dependencies.

5. Difficulties when training RNNs:
   - Vanishing gradients: RNNs can suffer from vanishing gradients, where gradients diminish exponentially over time. This hinders the learning of long-term dependencies. Techniques like LSTM and GRU address this issue by introducing gating mechanisms.
   - Exploding gradients: Conversely, RNNs can also experience exploding gradients, where gradients grow exponentially. Gradient clipping is a technique used to alleviate this problem by scaling gradients when they exceed a threshold.
   - Long-term memory: Standard RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies in sequences. LSTM and GRU networks were designed to alleviate this issue by incorporating memory cells and gating mechanisms.
   - Overfitting: RNNs, especially with large numbers of parameters, are prone to overfitting, especially when training on small datasets. Regularization techniques like dropout and L2 regularization can help mitigate overfitting.
   - Computational complexity: Training large RNNs can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Techniques like mini-batch training, GPU acceleration, and model optimization can help improve training efficiency.

6. Architecture of an LSTM cell:
   ```
               ---------------------------
              |                         |
        --->|       Forget Gate        |
       |  |                         |
       |  ---------------------------
       |
       |  ---------------------------
       | |                         |
       | |        Input Gate        | ----> Cell State
       | |                         |
       |  ---------------------------
       |
       |  ---------------------------
       | |                         |
        -->       Output Gate       | ----> Hidden State
          |                         |
           ---------------------------
   ```

   An LSTM cell has three main components:
   - Forget Gate: Determines how much of the previous cell state should be forgotten or discarded.
   - Input Gate: Decides how much of the input should be added to the cell state.
   - Output Gate: Controls how much of the cell state should be output.

7. 1D convolutional layers are used in an RNN to capture local patterns or features within the input sequence. They can be used as a pre-processing step to extract informative features from the sequence before feeding it to the RNN. This can be beneficial when there are local dependencies or patterns that can be effectively captured by convolutional filters. 1D convolutional layers can help the RNN model focus on relevant features and reduce computational complexity.

8. To classify videos, a popular neural network architecture is the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). A 3D CNN extends the concept of 2D CNNs to incorporate spatial and temporal information in video data. By considering both spatial and temporal dimensions, 3D CNNs can effectively capture spatiotemporal patterns in videos, making them suitable for video classification tasks.

9. Training a classification model for the SketchRNN dataset using TensorFlow Datasets involves loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, building a model, and training it. Here's a high-level outline of the process:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load the SketchRNN dataset
dataset = tfds.load('sketchrnn', split='train')

# Preprocess the data
# Apply necessary preprocessing steps, such as scaling, normalization, padding, or one-hot encoding, as required by the model architecture and dataset.

# Build the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Define your model architecture using appropriate layers, such as LSTM, Dense, etc.
    # Specify the appropriate input shape based on the data.

])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(dataset, epochs=10)

# Evaluate the model
test_dataset = tfds.load('sketchrnn', split='test')
model.evaluate(test_dataset)
```

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and additional preprocessing, model design, and hyperparameter tuning may be required for achieving the best accuracy on the SketchRNN dataset.
